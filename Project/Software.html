            <p align="justify">As an experimenter, have you ever confused about getting no result when all experimental
                conditions are well enough? Or have you ever been tired of repeating the experiment over and over again
                without knowing whether your pay is futile? Or have you ever dreamed of choosing an imported gene by
                global regulation instead of only direct interaction? If yes, take a gNAP before wearing lab
                gloves!<br /><br />
                gNAP, genetic Network Analyze and Predict, is a software analyze the infection of exogenous gene to
                engineered bacteria’s Genetic Regulatory Network(GRN) and introduce a predicted imported gene satisfying
                your needs!<br /><br />
                To reach the best user experience, we designed four succinct User Interfaces on which you just need to
                click some buttons and all the questions above will be solved.

                    src="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/3/36/USTC-Software_start.png" /></div>


            <p align="justify">“Starter” has only one button which could lead users to input all information needed for
                the next simulation and get ready to start. It is an easy-to-use interface guiding users to complete the
                operation according to the prompts. The exogenous transcription unit’s promoter and gene sequence shall
                be put into gNAP in this part. If not, users could not use analyze function, yet predict module can
                function normally. All the database files will be integrated in this part and genetic information will
                be stored in an external file, “all_info”, eventually. The original GRN is built in “Starter” with a
                matrix of regulation in file “old_GRN”.<br /><br />
                Now, it’s time to start taking a gNAP!

            <p>This shows the function of forward analysis.</p>

            <div class="image" align="center"><img
                    src="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/8/8a/USTC-Software_monitor.png" /></div>
            <p>This shows the function of reverse analysis.</p>

            <p align="justify">"Monitor" is one of the main module of our software as a monitor keeping watch on
                running. The command lines in "Monitor" intuitively shows the detail in the process of software running.
                There are two main functions in this part. One of which is analysis function that simulate the infection
                of new gene's importing before and the simple evaluation of new GRN. The new GRN matrix is output into a
                file called “new_GRN”. This function may cost about 3 minutes, so taking a nap will be a good choice.
                The procession running and command lines' showing are synchronous. Prediction function is another one
                which can be operated with adding the desired target expression instead of inputting the exogenous gene
                sequence. The running time of this part is determined by the precision and the number of iteration time
                in prediction algorithms. "Monitor" is very easy to operate through some simple action buttons and
                intelligent gene selection mode.</br></br>

                The result of this monitor can be found in "Result" and "Display".</p>

        </div>


        <div id="Result" class="contain">
            <h2>Result</h2>

            <div class="image" align="center"><img
                    src="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/8/89/USTC_Software_Software_result.png" /></div>

            <p align="justify">"Result" uses simply words to show the results of all functions of gNAP intuitively.
                There are two parts in the interface showing different results about the modules of analyze and predict.
                <br /><br />
                In the part of analysis, the stability has been scored into five degrees and users can choose a specific
                gene showing its information. All the information can generate an SBOL file as well as searching genetic
                information in RegulonDB. In the other part of prediction, target expression and predicted interactions
                are shown in a table. Users could pick out the significant regulation as a reference of genetic choice.
                <br /><br />
                The most succinct words have been used in this part to give users the most intuitive and clearest
                results. The graphs and vivid network structure will be put into "Display" with JAVA's rich GUI library.
            </p>
        </div>





        <div id="Display" class="contain">
            <h2>Display</h2>
            <p align="justify">“Display” is the data visualization part of our software. To reach a better impression,
                it had been written in JAVA language. There are three parts in “Display” module: show regulation, show
                gene change and show network. The prediction of interaction between new gene and original genes can be
                seen in “show regulation” part with both regulated and regulating. “Show gene change” part shows the
                changing of all genes with the time changing. What’s more, users could see the interactions of whole
                network in “show network” part. Dragging, choosing, picking out the genes in GUI is available. When
                choosing one gene in a giant network, all genes who have interactions with that one will be picked out
                and shown in a small network.

            For example, if users need to find a gene which can enhance geneA’s expression, depress geneB’s expression,
            enhance..., gFinder can find a gene whose function is similar most from the database. So, with the help of
            gFinder, the reverse analysis result of gNAP, our main software, can step forward. We could get the specific
            gene for target expression instead of some interactions. Users could also input the known regulation to get
            the specific gene from database.

                major software “gNAP”. To make the app more interesting, we reduced the difficulty of analysis and
                investigate the analytical thinking ability of complex network regulation.

            <h2>Tutorial</h2>


            <p>• Press ‘start’ to begin the game,</p>

            <p>• After you entered the game interface, you can right click the gene (those colorful circles) to find out
                how other genes change if you remove the gene you choose. </p>
            <p>• Then you should judge the relationship among the genes. There are two kinds of relationships,
                suppression and promotion. Attention, not all genes have relationship with other genes, and every two
                genes can only have one relationship. For example, gene1 suppresses gene2, then they can’t have other
                relationship such as gene1 promotes gene2 or gene2 suppresses gene1 etc.</p>
            <p>• When you have already judged all genes, you can make you own regulatory network. Press the suppression
                button and the you can draw a red arrow between two genes. If gene1 points to gene2, it means gene1
                suppresses gene2. In the similar way, you can draw green arrows with promotion button.</p>
            <p>• If you what to undo the last operation, press the cancel button.</p>
            <p>• When you have finished you operation, press finish button.</p>
            <p>• The bar on the left is control by time and the quality of your job. When this bar disappears, the game
                is over.</p>
            <p>• If you press the finish button, the answer button and next button will available. Press the answer
                button to check the answer (the answer may not be unique, so even if your answer is different with the
                answer that computer gives you, you may also get a high score).Press the next button to the next level.
            </p>
            <p>• In the next level, you can see how much score you have got in previous level.</p>
            <p>• If you want to quit game, press back button on the right-up corner.</p>
            <p>• There are 10 levels waiting for you! Good luck and have fun!</p>
