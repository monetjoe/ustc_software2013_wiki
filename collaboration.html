                USTC-China is a wet lab team which also attends iGEM this year. We collaborated with them by giving a
                reference to their experiments. <br><br>
                “Take a gNAP before wearing lab gloves!” is the catchword of our software. So we invited USTC_China to
                take a gNAP before their experiment.<br><br>
                In their project, GFP expressed in E.coli contributes to the signal system which is a indispensable
                part. Before they imported GFP gene into E.coli, our team used their data of genetic line to predict the
                expression of GFP in E.coli.<br><br>
                The genetic line is as follows:<br><br>
                <img src="./assets/src/USTC-Software_String.png" /><br><br><br><br>
                By using the Analyze function of our software, the result is as follows:<br><br>
                <img src="./assets/src/USTC-Software_Cowork1.jpg" /><br>
            <p align="center"> Four stars means the stability of the GRN is good.</p><br><br><br><br>
            <img src="./assets/src/USTC-Software_cowork2.jpg" /><br>
            <p align="center">This is the expression changing of GFP.</p><br><br>
            <p>After comparing with other genes in the network, we predict that GFP could get a normal expression in
                E.coli. <br><br><br>
                This is the SDS page of their experiments:<br>
                <img src="./assets/src/USTC-Software_Cowork3.jpg" /><br><br>
                From the SDS page we know that GFP expressed in E.coli and its strength is not very high. It confirms
                the result of our software.
