                USTC-China is a wet lab team which also attends iGEM this year. We collaborated with them by giving a
                reference to their experiments. <br /><br />
                “Take a gNAP before wearing lab gloves!” is the catchword of our software. So we invited USTC_China to
                take a gNAP before their experiment.<br /><br />
                In their project, GFP expressed in E.coli contributes to the signal system which is a indispensable
                part. Before they imported GFP gene into E.coli, our team used their data of genetic line to predict the
                expression of GFP in E.coli.<br /><br />
                The genetic line is as follows:<br /><br />

                By using the Analyze function of our software, the result is as follows:<br /><br />

            <p align="center"> Four stars means the stability of the GRN is good.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />
            <img src="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/d/db/USTC-Software_cowork2.jpg" /><br />
            <p align="center">This is the expression changing of GFP.</p><br /><br />
            <p>After comparing with other genes in the network, we predict that GFP could get a normal expression in
                E.coli. <br /><br /><br />
                This is the SDS page of their experiments:<br />
                <img src="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/e/ed/USTC-Software_Cowork3.jpg" /><br /><br />
                From the SDS page we know that GFP expressed in E.coli and its strength is not very high. It confirms
                the result of our software.
