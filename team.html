                    Chenkun Wang is a senior undergraduate majoring in condensed matter physics. As a team leader of
                    USTC-Software, he participated in nearly every part of project. He not only accomplished the basic
                    construction of software, but also was responsible for the development of starter module as well as
                    the database fetching coding. What's more, he completed the GUI of our software with the help of
                    Shuai Ma.
                    After nearly half year's working for the competition of iGEM_2013_Software, he became overwhelming
                    interested in command line and simulation. He will graduate next year and he hopes to continue such
                    work in his future studies. His dream is to pursue a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering.

                    improved it. In the development process, Jinyang has found an interesting phenomenon in the gene
                    regulation network of Escherichia coli and prepared to study it further. He also made contribution
                    to art design of the project.<br>
                    At school, he is a director of a volunteer organization. Because of the work of the iGEM
                    competition, he got interested in complex network and prepared to join the Nonlinear Science and

                    interests in CS and was in charge of genetic network calculation division. The experience of working
                    in igem team is really exciting, for he met a lot of people here and they worked as a team. He also
                    learnt something new by himself and had a new vision on biology.

                    Hello,I am Shaohua Chen ,an undergraduate in USTC. Before joining in 2013 USTC-Software ,I knew
                    little about the Internet.To change this bad situation ,I was determined to join in USTC-Software
                    where I could not only learn Internet but also know more biology.So it's an honour for me to
                    cooperate with many gifted and responsible teammates ,from whom I learned a lot. In the team , I am
                    in charge of the wiki,during the process ,I find that a person's ability is limited,teamwork makes
                    our work more efficient.

                    Tianhao Zhang is a junior undergraduate majoring in biophysics. However he didn't have much biology
                    training because of the junior grade. He is responsible for the little java application which is
                    independence from our major program. He also helped Xinyu Liao to build the modle of network and
                    find suitable equation used in network analysis.<br>

                    Besides biology, He is also interested in computer science so he studied dual degree in school. He
                    think iGEM software is a great program to combine computer science and biology together. That's why
                    he joined in and became a member of us.

                    <b>Brief Intro:</b><br>
                    Chen Shao, as a junior student major in mathematics, is interested in learning in and out of major
                    area. Without training in biology, she just joined in with passion and persistence. She is
                    participating in the later stage of the genetic network application, such as calculating for an
                    optimal solution of the gene. In her job, she combined classical algorithms and our networks'
                    features, in order to optimize the codes and results. In her eyes, it is a happy and enjoyable
                    process with excellent partners.
