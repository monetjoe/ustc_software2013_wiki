            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p align="justify">This little app is a gaming program for children who are interested in network analysis.
                Through this game they can cultivate the interest of biology and have a visual image of complex
                regulatory network. The calculation module is as same as the modeling of GRN in our major software
                “gNAP”. To make the app more interesting, we reduced the difficulty of analysis and investigate the
                analytical thinking ability of complex network regulation.

            <h2>Tutorial</h2>


            <p>• Press 'start' to begin the game,</p>

            <p>• After you enter the game interface, you can press the gene (those colorful circles) with right button
                to find out how other gene change if you remove the gene you choose. </p>
            <p>• Then you should judge the relationship among the genes. There are two kinds of relationships,
                suppression and promotion. Attention, not all genes have relationship with other genes, and every two
                genes can only have one relationship. For example, gene1 suppresses gene2, then they can't have other
                relationship such as gene1 promotes gene2 or gene2 suppresses gene1 etc.</p>
            <p>• When you have already judged all genes, you can make you own regulatory network. Press the suppression
                button and the you can draw a red arrow between two genes. If gene1 points to gene2, it means gene1
                suppresses gene2. In the similar way, you can draw green arrows with promotion button.</p>
            <p>• If you what to undo the last operation, press the cancel button.</p>
            <p>• When you have finished you operation, press finish button.</p>
            <p>• The bar on the left is control by time and the quality of your job. When this bar disappears, the game
                is over.</p>
            <p>• If you press the finish button, the answer button and next button will available. Press the answer
                button to check the answer (the answer may not be unique, so even if your answer is different with the
                answer that computer shows you, you may also get a high score).Press the next button to next level.</p>
            <p>• In the next level, you can see how much score you have got in forward level.</p>
            <p>• If you want to quit game, press back button in the right-up corner.</p>
            <p>• There are 10 levels waiting for you! Good luck!</p>
